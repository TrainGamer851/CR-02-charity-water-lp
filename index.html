        <h2>Lead Student Activism for Cleaner Water Worldwide</h2>
        <p>
          While we are making progress in our academics in college or university, the world is experiencing a water crisis.
          Millions of people lack access to clean water, leading to health and environmental issues.
          As student activists, we can help fund projects to expand clean water access globally.
          Our contributions create opportunity, equality, and change—so let’s be part of a movement for measurable impact.
